# Contact Form — Portfolio Project

A responsive, JavaScript-powered contact form built as part of my front-end web development learning journey.  
This form validates user input without reloading the page and provides user feedback in a clean UI.

## 🧩 Project Overview

This project is a simple contact form with dynamic validation and feedback built using only:

- **HTML** for structure  
- **CSS** for layout and responsive design  
- **JavaScript** for interaction and validation

It mimics real-world form behavior found on many websites, but without using any libraries or frameworks.

## ✨ Features

✔️ Checks required fields  
✔️ Validates basic email format  
✔️ Displays error (red) or success (green) messages  
✔️ Responsive layout for mobile and desktop  
✔️ Clean and accessible UI

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The form uses JavaScript’s `addEventListener("submit")` to handle submission.
2. `preventDefault()` stops the browser from reloading.
3. Input values are read from the DOM using `getElementById(...)`.
4. JavaScript checks:
   - If any fields are empty
   - If the email is in a basic valid format (regex)
5. Based on validation:
   - Error messages are shown with a red style
   - Success message shown with green style
6. Form resets after successful submit.

This demonstrates core DOM manipulation and form validation without external libraries.
